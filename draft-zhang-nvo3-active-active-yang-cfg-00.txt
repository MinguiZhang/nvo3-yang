          YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEs Configuration
             draft-zhang-nvo3-yang-active-active-cfg-00.txt

Abstract

   When a Tenant System is not collocated with Network Virtualization
   Edges (NVEs), it's possible for this Tenant System to connect to a
   group of NVEs to use the active-active multihoming L2/L3 service
   provided by these NVEs.

   This document defines the YANG data model that can be used to
   configure NVEs of a NVO3 network to achieve active-active multi-
   homing.

INTERNET-DRAFT   YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEs October 27, 2014


1. Introduction

   Network virtualization over Layer 3 tunnels (NOV3) is a promising way
   for large scale data center network provision. If the Network
   Virtualization Edge (NVE) and the Tenant System are separated, the
   NVE sits at the edge of an underlay network of NVO3 and provides
   virtualized L2 and/or L3 service to the Tenant Systems. If a Tenant
   System is multihomed to various NVEs, it's desirable that these NVEs
   provide the Tenant System with active-active multihoming.

   This document provides the YANG model for configuring NVEs to offer
   Tenant Systems with active-active L2 and/or L3 access to NVEs, which
   admits centralized provisioning of virtualization (i.e. NVA based).

2. Acronyms and Terminology

2.1. Acronyms

   NVO3: Network Virtualization Overlays
   NVE: Network Virtualization Edge
   NVA: Network Authority Virtualization
   VNI: Virtual Network Instance
   VAP: Virtual Access Points [RFC7365]
   AANVE: Active-Active NVEs. The AANVE denotes the group of NVEs that
     offer active-active multi-homing VAPs to Tenant Systems. 

2.2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with [RFC7364], [RFC7365], [I-D.ietf-nvo3-dataplane-
   requirements] and [RFC7348] is assumed in this document.

3. The YANG Model for NVO3 Configuration

3.1. The Configuration Values

3.1.1. The End Device ID

   The 'end-id' is the identification of an end device [RFC7365] which
   can either be an L2 (a LAN) or L3 (a subnetwork) network device. This
   ID also identifies the redundant group of NVEs that offers the L2/L3
   active-active access to the NVO3 overlay network. This ID may be
   shared among different Virtual Networks (a.k.a, Closed User Groups,
   CUGs [RFC7365]).

INTERNET-DRAFT   YANG Data Model for Active-Active NVEs October 27, 2014


3.1.2. The NVE List

   Each NVE is identified by the 'nve-id' that is the underlay IP
   address which can either be IPV4 or IPv6 [RFC7365].

   If the network is configured, NVEs in an AANVE will discover each
   other while remote NVEs learn the grouping of NVEs multi-homing to a
   end device.

3.1.2.1. The Priority

   For a BUM packet, the AANVE MUST determine a unique egress NVE
   otherwise the multi-homed Tenant System will see frame duplication.
   The 'priority' describes the primary and backup NVEs in an AANVE per
   VNI. For the BUM packet, the primary in the AANVE is supposed to act
   as the unique outgoing NVE. Other backup NVEs MUST NOT egress the BUM
   packet onto the end device.

3.1.2.2. The Virtual Access Points List

   The 'vap-list' specifies the interfaces that a NVE uses to connect to
   the multi-homed end device. For those VAPs listed in the 'vap-list',
   packets with ingress NVEs which are listed in the same AANVE as the
   VAPs' hosted NVE MUST NOT be egressed. This embodies the split-
   horizon.

   When a NVE is configured to have more than one VAPs for a given
   AANVE, the NVE MUST determine a unique VAP to deliver a received
   packet to the local tenant system.

3.1.4. The Virtual Network Instance

   The 'vni' specifies the identification of Virtual Network Instance
   [RFC7365]. The 'multi-attached-info' configuration is valid per VNI.

3.1.3. The Attached Tenant System Address List

   The 'attached-ts-addresses' given in the model is used to configure
   NVEs within a VNI the Tenant System MAC/IP addresses attached to the
   multi-homed end device. From the configuration, remote NVEs learn
   these addresses are multi-homed to the NVEs listed in the 'nve-list',
   therefore packet destined to these addresses are reachable via any of
   the listed NVEs. One of the learned NVEs will be installed into the
   data plane as the egress NVE on a per-VNI or per-ts-address basis.

   For L2 service, the MAC list in the configuration is prone to be more
   unstable than other part. Control protocols can be used to push the
   update of the MAC list per VNI. For example, [I-D.draft-dunbar-nvo3-

   nva-mapping-distribution] can be used to distribute the MAC address
   of Tenant Systems. When the updated MAC list is pushed, it's REQUIRED
   that the 'end-id' is taken along. Through hearing the 'end-id',
   remote NVEs can identify the AANVE to which the pushed MAC addresses
   are attached.

4. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.

5. IANA Considerations

   The namespace URI defined in Section 3.3 need be registered in the
   IETF XML registry [RFC3688]. 

   This document need to register the 'nvo3-aanve' YANG module in the
   YANG Module Names registry [RFC6020].
